# DB_application
## Description
Desktop application provides fancy and user-friendly interface to work with MsSQL Database.
It supports:
* all CRUD functions 
* sorting 
* filtering
* search for entry with certain parameters.

It also provides such features to work with 'storage' DB (dump is in this repo), as:
* Adding several entries at one click
* Removing outdated items every period of time, specified in settings

> Features above are made with stored procedures and triggers which are in DB dump

## Installation
Simply download and unpack the repository and change connection settings(in main.py constant).

If you feel for using my DB dump, just run script.sql within MsSQL program.
